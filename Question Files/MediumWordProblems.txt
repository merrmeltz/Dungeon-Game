{name} cut a {food1} into {num1} pieces*{name} eats {numless1} pieces*What fraction in simplest form*shows the portion of the {food1} eaten?;{fraction1};{fraction2};{fraction3};{fraction1};Tip: Write the numerator (Think about how many pieces were used)*Now write the denominator (Think about the total number of pieces)*Now to simplify:*divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF)
{name} has {num1} {food1}s, {num2} {food2}s, and {num3} {food3}s*What fraction of {name}s foods are {food1}s?;{num1}/{total};{num1}/{nummore1};{fraction1};{num1}/{total};Tip: Think about {food1} as s fraction of the total food
At lunch {name} ate {num1} {orderedFraction1} of {food1}*and {name2} ate {num1} {orderedFraction2} of {food1}*Who ate more?;{name2};{name};Neither;{name2};Tip:First compare the whole numbers*This can give you a clue to which is bigger*Then compare the fractions*Find the common denominator to make comparing easier*
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} X {fraction2} = ;{fractionMult2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionMult2};Tip:Do not forget to multiply the numerator and denominators*And Simplify! 
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} divided by {fraction2} = ;{fractionDiv2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionDiv2};Tip:To divide to the reciprocal of the second fraction*(flip it)*Then multiply the fractions*
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} + {fraction2} = ;{fractionAdd2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionAdd2};Tip: Remember to find the least common denominator and write the equivalent fractions*Then add the numerators*Do not forget to simplify when you are done!
The answer is written in simplest form: {orderedFraction3} - {orderedFraction2} = ;{fractionSub2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionSub2};Tip:Remember to find the least common denominator and write the equivalent fractions*Then subtract the numerators*Do not forget to simplify when you are done!
Which of the following shows {num}{numless}% as a decimal?;.{num}{numless};.0{num}{numless};{num}{numless};.{num}{numless};Tip:To convert percents to decimals*just move the decimal point 2 places to the left*and remove the "%" sign! 
Which are equivalent?;{num1}0% and .{num1};{num1}0% and .00{num1};{num2}0% and .{num1};{num1}0% and .{num1};Tip:To convert percents to decimals*just move the decimal point 2 places to the left*and remove the "%" sign!
