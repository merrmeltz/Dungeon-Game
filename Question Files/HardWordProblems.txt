{name} has {orderedFraction3} of a {food1}*and gives {orderedFraction1} of it away to {name2}*How much {food1} does {name} have left?;{otherFraction};{fraction1};1/1{num1};{otherFraction};Tip:First find the least common denominator*Then write the equivalent fractions*Now think about the total {name} was giving away*How much less is this than what {name} started with?
{name}, {name2}, and {name3} are at a picnic*{name} has {orderedFraction2} of a {food1}*{name2} has {orderedFraction1} of a {food2}*{name3} has {orderedFraction3} of a {food3}*Order the names from who has*the least of their food to who has the most;{name2}, {name}, {name3};{name}, {name2}, {name3};{name3}, {name2}, {name};{name2}, {name}, {name3};Tip: Use the least common multiple of the denominators*to find the least common denominator*Write the equivalent fractions with the least common denominator*Then compare the fractions!
{name} ate {fraction1} of a {food1} on Monday*and {fraction2} of a {food2} on Thursday*How much food did {name} eat during the week?;{fractionAdd2};{numless1}/{num1};{numless3}/{num2};{fractionAdd2};Tip:add together the fraction of food eaten on Monday*and the fraction of food eaten on Thursday*This gives you the total food eaten during the week*
{name} eats {orderedFraction1} of a {food1} for breakfast and dinner*How much {food1} does {name} eat in a day?;{otherFraction2};{fraction2};{fraction1};{otherFraction2};Tip:add together the fraction of food eaten in the morning*and the fraction of food eaten at dinner*This gives you the total food eaten during the day
{name} split a {food1} into {num1} slices*{name} ate {numless1} parts of the {food1}*What percent of the {food1} was eaten?;{fraction1Percent}%;{num}{numless}.00%;{num3}.00%;{fraction1Percent}%;Tip:To convert fractions to percents*divide the top of the fraction by the bottom*then multiply by 100 and add a "%" sign!
{name}s family has two equal size {food1}s*Each {food1} was cut into {num1} equal pieces*The family ate one whole {food1} and {numless1} pieces of the other {food1}*What Mixed Fraction shows how much {food1} was eaten?;{num3} 1/{num1};1 {numless1}/{num1};{num2} {numless1}/{num1};1 {numless1}/{num1};Tip: Think about how many whole pieces of {food1} were eaten*This is your whole number*Now think about what fraction represents 1 piece of one {food1}*This can help you create your fraction
{name} ate {fraction1Percent}% of his {food1}*What fraction of {food1} is left?;{fraction1};{fraction2};{fraction3};{fraction1};Tip:To convert from a percent to a fraction*write down the percent divided by 100*then simplify!
